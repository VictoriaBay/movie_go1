## Introduction

In this Project, my task is to analyze public movie databases and explore what type of films are currently doing the best at movie production business

## Business Understanding

The project centers around the scenario in which Microsoft is entering the movie production business. Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is that this is a new industry for them, and they don't have any experience

## Data Understanding

The data that I will use for this project contains information from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
* Online research, which contains worldwide statistics

## Aims and objectives

A film production company produces video content for television, social media, corporate promotions, commercials, or other media-related fields. This project aims to advise Microsoft on trends, identify main success key points, and turn them into actionable insights, which will help Microsoft reach its goal in minimum time.



## Methods

This project uses descriptive analytics including changes in trends over time & comparitive analysis between movie features. This provides meanigul insight in movie industry trends.

## Results
* Which genres of movies are the most profitable?
* Most popular movie genres?
* What is the preferable length, for your movie to get a top rating

Right, I couldn’t start without having a look at what genres make the most money. There are many types of genres, each averaging a wide distribution of profit since 2010. Based on the data available, the top 5 averaging film genres were Adventure, Action, Fantasy, and Family. Interestingly, Adventure films tend to average more than twice as much profit as thrillers, animations, and documentaries.  I assumed that the mean would be the most reliable average with the data we had and another assumption was that films have a single genre or multiple genres as well

### Most popular movie genres in the United States and Canada between 1995 to 2022, by total box office revenue

Between 1995 and early 2022, adventure was the highest-grossing movie genre at the so-called North American box office, which consists of Canada and the United States. Adventure films recorded a box office revenue of almost 65 billion U.S. dollars within that period. Action movies followed with more than 50 billion dollars in revenue


### Global box office revenue of the most successful movies of all time as of 2022

With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, Avatar is proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and don't take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings."Avengers: Endgame" (2019) and "Titanic" (1997) followed, with revenues of around 2.8 billion and 2.2 billion dollars, respectively.

Below I have considered the types and number of films that our competitors are making. Universal Studios and 20th Century Fox have produced the largest amount leading films by gross, their focus has been on Action and Drama. All through the list, there is a common theme of the leaders producing films in the genres of Action, Drama and Comedy. We would recommend doing the same for consistent results.

## Conclusion

Preparation, modelling, visualisation and interpretation of the data, allowed me to conduct analysis of the movies using the data provided

* the best entry market movies for high revenue are multiple genre movies
* the lengthiest movies should be between 120 - 140 minutes maximum
* the industry leaders preferred creating Action, Drama & Comedy films
